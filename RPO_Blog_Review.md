# Review of [Blog: *Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks*](https://github.com/Mohaimin41/CSE_471_ML_Asm/blob/main/README.md)

### Summary
The blog provides an accessible overview of the *Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO)* approach to defending language models against jailbreak attacks, which was brought to light by the paper titled ["Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jXs6Cvpe7k), published in NeurIPS 2024. Through an engaging narrative and relatable analogies, it introduces the problem, explains core concepts like minimax optimization and defensive suffixes, outlines the experimental setup, and evaluates the practical impact of RPO. It summarizes the paper's results effectively, focusing on the reduction of attack success rates (ASRs) and the transferability of RPO defenses.
